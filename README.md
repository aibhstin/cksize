# cksize

A super simple utility got getting the rough size of a file. 
Supports files up to the terabytes. This utility simply 
gives you the size of a file in human-readable units. If you 
want exact file sizes, this isn't the tool for you. I forgot 
why I was making this halfway through making it.
